# Electron Positioner Library

This is a vendored copy of the [electron-positioner](https://github.com/jenslind/electron-positioner) library. Which is the `menubar` vendored lib's only dependency.

The lib has not been updated for a long time. Since we're vendoring `menubar` we've decided to pull this in too, instead of depending on another unmaintained library in package.json.
